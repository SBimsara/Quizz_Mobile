#L2 IN2900-Industry Based Project

## Introduction
Our project addresses the challenges faced by secondary students in Sri Lanka, particularly those preparing for the G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examination. This examination plays a crucial role in determining students' future educational paths. To excel in this exam, students often struggle with manual searches for study materials and lack of motivation. To tackle these issues, we have developed a mobile quiz application.
